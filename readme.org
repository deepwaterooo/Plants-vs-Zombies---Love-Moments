* Plants vs Zombies - Love Moments
- A California - Washington love moments sharing version of plants vs zombies android opengl 3d game implemented using Unity, with plot of the play discussing the everlasting topics of life and love.
- A love story version of plants vs zombies android opengl 3d game, while aim to express individual suffering and the most cherished love from her life. 
- The original ideas came from youtube videoes which I watched last night, and feel want to make a version of my own, with feels & moments originally came from the most cherished moments for my life.  
- Will start work in this one after tetris opengl game is done. 
- Target for June 2016 to be finished, could extends to Sep 2016 depends on how much time I could devote on my study every day. 
- Instead of developping all the code using Android Studio opengl 3d (as I thought a few days ago, after googling and basic research), I tuned my mind to use Unity 3d so that it will be much easier and more practical to implement for the large 3d games. 
  - So far has the Unity 3d, Android SDK, NDK, Java environment ready, as well as Unity remote from my phone are all setup and ready for building app. 
  - Need to review C# fundamentals to focus on Unity C# coding (I had progrmed using C# for a while before, so there is no challenge for me to choose and use this language for Unity, I just need to refamiliar myself with the grammers, as well as configure comfortable programming environment for cs-mode for Emacs). 
  - Need to learn basics for Unity 3D. 
  - Will work on these fundamentals whenever I have occisional time recently, so that I could be in rail as soon as possible.
