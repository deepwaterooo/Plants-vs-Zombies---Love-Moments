\section{Plants vs Zombies - Love Moments}
\label{sec-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item A love story version of plants vs zombies android opengl 3d game, while aim to express individual suffering and love.
\item The original ideas came from youtube videoes which I watched last night, and feel want to make a version of my own, with feels \& moments originally came from the most cherished moments for my life.
\item Will start work in this one after tetris opengl game is done.
\item Target for June 2016 to be finished, could extends to Sep 2016 depends on how much time I could devote on my study every day.
\item Instead of developping all the code using Android Studio opengl 3d, I changed my mind to use Unity 3d so that it will be much easier to implement for large 3d games. 
\begin{itemize}
\item So far has the Unity 3d, Android SDK, NDK, Java environment ready, as well as Unity remote from my phone.
\item Need to review C\# fundamental to focus on Unity C\# coding (I had progrmed using C\# for a while, so there is no problem to choose and use this one for Unity at all, just needs to refamiliar myself with the grammers, as well as configure comfortable programming environment for cs-mode for Emacs).
\item Need to learn basics for Unity 3D.
\item Will work on these fundamentals whenever I have occisional time recently, so that I could be in rail as soon as possible.
\end{itemize}
