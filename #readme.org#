* Plants vs Zombies - Love Moments
- A love story version of plants vs zombies android opengl 3d game, while aim to express individual suffering and love. 
- The original ideas came from youtube videoes which I watched last night, and feel want to make a version of my own, with feels & moments originally came from the most cherished moments for my life.  
- Will start work in this one after tetris opengl game is done. 
- Target for June 2016 to be finished, could extends to Sep 2016 depends on how much time I could devote on my study every day. 
- Instead of developping all the code using Android Studio opengl 3d, I changed my mind to use Unity 3d so that it will be much easier to implement for large 3d games. 
  - So far has the Unity 3d, Android SDK, NDK, Java environment ready, as well as Unity remote from my phone.
